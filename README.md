# Bizu-Project
1. Login with username and password (iOS: Objective C, Android: Java)
    -Currently the Bizu app allows users to access Bizu if they authenticate with Facebook. adding the ability for users to
    create a username and password will mean that Bizu will not receive profile information from Facebook and thus ahve to
    ask the user for the follwoing upon account creation:name, DOB, email, phone#, zip code, gender, status, favorite city 
    and contain a profile picture uploader.
2. Password Module (.Net and Angular JS, HTML): 
    - venue admins need the ability to change or reset their password via the admin dashboard.This should reside under My
    Venue as a 4th menu option. Once use, Bizu should send an email to the admin notifying of the password reset/change
